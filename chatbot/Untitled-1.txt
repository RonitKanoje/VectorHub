Remote Dictionary Server) is an in-memory key–value database, used as a distributed cache and message broker, with optional durability.

It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country since 2023; and, since its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is near Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Myanmar, Thailand, and Indonesia.\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago. Their long occupation, predominantly in isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse. Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest. Its hymns recorded the early dawnings of Hinduism in India.  India's pre-existing Dravidian languages were supplanted in the northern regions. By 400 BCE, caste had emerged within Hinduism, and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity. Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires. Widespread creativity suffused this era, but the status of women declined, and untouchability became an organised belief. In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian language scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.\nIn the 1st millennium, Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts. In the early centuries of the 2nd millennium Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains. The resulting Delhi Sultanate drew northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam. In south India, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture. In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion. The Mughal Empire ushered in two centuries of economic expansion and relative peace, and left a rich architectural legacy. Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company turned India into a colonial economy but consolidated its sovereignty. British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly, but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root. A nationalist movement emerged in India, the first in the non-European British Empire and an influence on other nationalist movements. Noted for nonviolent resistance after 1920, it became the primary factor in ending British rule. In 1947, the British Indian Empire was partition", 'additional_kwargs': {}, 'response_metadata': {}, 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'wikipedia', 'id': '4645d788-fc6f-401a-8710-1f6eeb8a7361', 'tool_call_id': 'e2ca8790-84d1-4781-b404-8ffbb8184a9e', 'artifact': None, 'status': 'success'}, {'content': '\nYou are a retrieval-augmented assistant.\n\nPrimary rules:\n- Use the provided RAG context as the main source of truth.\n- If the answer is NOT present in the RAG context:\n  - You MAY use external tools (e.g., Wikipedia, DuckDuckGo) and say answer is not mentioned in the video or provided content.\n- Do NOT guess, infer, or add information beyond the available sources.\n\nMetadata usage:\n- Use timing or section metadata ONLY when the user explicitly asks "when", "where", or refers to timestamps or sections.\n- Do NOT mention metadata unless it is relevant to the question.\n\nAnswering style:\n- Be concise, clear, and direct.\n- Base every factual claim on either the RAG context or an explicitly used tool.\n- If the question is unrelated to the provided context and no search is requested, politely explain that external search would be required.\n\n        Context:Facebook Google all major tech companies are\xa0\nrelying on Redis to increase performance and\xa0\xa0 speed of their applications in this video I will\xa0\nbe covering everything Redis from what it is how\xa0\xa0 it works the basics of Redis and how to implement\xa0\nRedis into your application you might be wondering\xa0\xa0 what exactly is Redis well Redis is an in memory\xa0\ndatabase which runs completely on your machine\'s\xa0\xa0 Ram Random Access Memory but don\'t mistake speed\xa0\nfor Simplicity Redis is a Powerhouse supporting\xa0\xa0 a wide range of different data structures from\xa0\nstrings to lists to different types of indexes\xa0\xa0 but how does Redis work as it\'s an inmemory\xa0\ndatabase which means it relies on caching\xa0\xa0\n\nbut we just have that value looking so we can say\xa0\nvalue equals app.st state. rdus get entries if the\xa0\xa0 value is none well that means we need to fetch\xa0\nit from the API and then save it within in our\xa0\xa0 Rus database under the key of entries so this\xa0\nis good if value is none we want our response\xa0\xa0 to equal that we can then go ahead and say value\xa0\nequals our Json response so we know our value is\xa0\xa0 now going to be equal to the Json response that we\xa0\nget from the API we can say data string because we\xa0\xa0 need to be able to convert this data into a string\xa0\nto set it for a key value pair so what we can say\xa0\xa0 is data string equals Json dumps and we pass in\xa0\nour value and so now data string is going to be\xa0\xa0\n\nneed say is from Fast API import fast API from\xa0\nRedis import Redis import httpx and then import\xa0\xa0 Json we then now need to say app equals our fast\xa0\nAPI application and now we need to have a startup\xa0\xa0 a shutdown and then our application so let\'s\xa0\nfirst start with our startup so we can say a app\xa0\xa0 do on event where we can say startup we want this\xa0\nto be an async def startup event where we can say\xa0\xa0 app. state.
